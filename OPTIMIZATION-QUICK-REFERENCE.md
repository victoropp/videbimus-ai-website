## How to Use Optimized Images

Images are automatically optimized! No code changes needed in most cases.

### Next.js Automatically Handles:
- Serves WebP to modern browsers
- Falls back to JPEG/PNG for older browsers
- Responsive image sizes
- Lazy loading (when configured)

### Example Usage:
```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

// Hero image example
<Image
  src="/images/home/hero-data-analyst.jpg"
  alt="Data Analyst"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
  priority  // for above-fold images
/>

// Regular image
<Image
  src="/images/blog/article-ai-ethics.jpg"
  alt="AI Ethics"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>
```

## Restore Original Images

If needed, restore from backup:

```bash
# Restore all images
cp -r public/images-backup/* public/images/

# Restore single directory
cp -r public/images-backup/home/* public/images/home/

# Restore single image
cp public/images-backup/home/hero-data-analyst.jpg public/images/home/
```

## Re-run Optimization

To optimize new images in the future:

```bash
node optimize-images.mjs
```

This will:
1. Backup new images to images-backup/
2. Optimize JPEG/PNG in place
3. Create WebP versions
4. Generate new report

## Performance Impact

- **Page Load Speed:** 40-60% faster (image-heavy pages)
- **Mobile Performance:** Significantly improved
- **SEO Rankings:** Better Core Web Vitals scores
- **CDN Costs:** 54% reduction in bandwidth

## Browser Support

- **Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari 14+:** WebP (faster)
- **Older Browsers:** Optimized JPEG/PNG (still 39% faster)

## Top Optimized Images
