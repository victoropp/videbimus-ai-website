## Technical Guidelines

### Image Optimization Standards

#### Formats (2025 Best Practices)

**Priority Order**:
1. **AVIF** (Recommended for 2025)
   - 50% smaller than JPEG with same quality
   - Best compression-to-quality ratio
   - Growing browser support
   - Use with fallbacks

2. **WebP** (Widely Supported)
   - 25-34% smaller than JPEG
   - Excellent browser support (97%+)
   - Best balance of quality and compatibility

3. **JPEG** (Fallback)
   - Universal browser support
   - Use as fallback for older browsers
   - Good for photographs

4. **PNG** (Specific Use Cases)
   - Use only for logos, icons with transparency
   - Large file sizes - avoid for photos

**Implementation Example**:
```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif">
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy">
</picture>
```

#### Size Requirements by Section

#### Performance Optimization

**Best Practices**:
1. **Responsive Images**: Use `srcset` for different screen sizes
   ```html
   <img
     srcset="image-400.webp 400w,
             image-800.webp 800w,
             image-1200.webp 1200w,
             image-1920.webp 1920w"
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px,
            (max-width: 1200px) 800px,
            (max-width: 1920px) 1200px,
            1920px"
     src="image-1200.webp"
     alt="Description"
   >
   ```

2. **Lazy Loading**: Implement for all images below the fold
   ```html
   <img src="image.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Description">
   ```

3. **CDN Delivery**: Serve images from CDN for faster global load times

4. **Compression**:
   - JPEG: 60-80% quality (sweet spot)
   - WebP: 75-85% quality
   - AVIF: 50-70% quality

5. **Page Size Budget**:
   - Total page size: 1-1.5 MB (never exceed 3 MB)
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5 seconds
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1

**Optimization Tools**:
- **Squoosh** (https://squoosh.app) - Google's image optimizer

## Brand Color Harmony

### Videbimus AI Color Palette

**Primary Colors**:
- **Primary Blue**: `#0F172A` (Dark slate for professionalism)
- **Cyan**: `#06B6D4` (Innovation and technology)
- **Purple**: `#8B5CF6` (Creativity and intelligence)

**Secondary Colors**:
- **Green**: `#10B981` (Success, growth, positive results)
- **Yellow/Gold**: `#F59E0B` (Energy, optimism)
- **Gray Scale**: `#F9FAFB` to `#111827`

### Image Selection by Color Psychology

**For Hero Sections**:
- Images with blue/cyan tones (trust, reliability, technology)
- Cool color temperatures (professional, modern)
- High-contrast scenes (dramatic, attention-grabbing)

**For Services**:
- Warm tones mixed with cool (approachable yet professional)
- Natural lighting (authentic, trustworthy)
- Balanced color saturation (not overwhelming)

**For Success/Results**:
- Green accents (growth, positive outcomes)
- Bright, well-lit scenes (optimism, clarity)
- Gold/yellow highlights (achievement, value)

**For Problem Statements**:
- Slightly desaturated (acknowledges challenges)
- Cooler tones (seriousness of issues)
- But not too dark (maintain hope)

### Color Filtering Techniques

**When Selecting Images**:
1. **Use Pixabay's color filter**: Search for images dominated by brand colors
2. **Complementary colors**: Choose images that complement brand palette
3. **Neutral backgrounds**: Select images with neutral backgrounds that allow brand colors to pop
4. **Overlay techniques**: Use colored overlays (15-30% opacity) to align images with brand

**CSS Overlay Example**:
```css
.hero-image {
  position: relative;
}

.hero-image::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg,
    rgba(6, 182, 212, 0.1) 0%,
    rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.15) 100%);
  mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

## Accessibility Requirements

### WCAG 2.1 Compliance (Level AA)

#### Alt Text Best Practices

**Formula**: Context + Content + Function

**Examples for Videbimus AI**:

❌ **Bad**: `alt="image1"`
❌ **Bad**: `alt="business meeting"`
✅ **Good**: `alt="Business team analyzing predictive maintenance dashboard showing 45% reduction in equipment failures"`

❌ **Bad**: `alt="person at computer"`
✅ **Good**: `alt="Data scientist reviewing machine learning model performance metrics on dual monitors"`

**Alt Text Guidelines**:
- **Length**: 125 characters or less (screen reader comfort)
- **Be Specific**: Describe what's relevant to the context
- **No "Image of"**: Screen readers already announce it's an image
- **Include Results**: For case studies, include key metrics
- **Decorative Images**: Use `alt=""` (empty string) for purely decorative images
- **Complex Images**: Use `aria-describedby` for detailed descriptions

**Template for Case Studies**:
```html
<img
  src="oil-gas-case-study.webp"
  alt="[Industry] company reduces [problem] by [percentage] using [solution type]"
  loading="lazy"
>
```

#### Color Contrast

**Text Over Images**:
- **Minimum Contrast**: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18px+)
- **Solutions**:
  - Dark overlay (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4-0.6))
  - Light overlay for dark text
  - Blur background behind text
  - Text shadows for better legibility

**Testing Tools**:
- Chrome DevTools Lighthouse
- WAVE Browser Extension
- Contrast Checker (https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

**Implementation Example**:
```css
.image-text-overlay {
  position: relative;
  background: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.7) 0%,
    rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.5) 100%
  );
  color: white; /* Ensures 4.5:1 contrast ratio */
}
```

#### Screen Reader Considerations

**Figure and Caption**:
```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="case-study.webp"
    alt="Petroverse oil platform monitoring system dashboard"
  >
  <figcaption>
    Real-time predictive maintenance system reduced equipment
    failures by 45% in first year, saving $2.5M annually.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

**Complex Images (Charts, Diagrams)**:
```html
<img
  src="data-chart.webp"
  alt="Bar chart showing cost reduction over 12 months"
  aria-describedby="chart-description"
>
<div id="chart-description" class="sr-only">
  Bar chart displaying monthly operational cost reductions from
  January to December 2024. Costs started at $100K in January
  and decreased steadily to $55K by December, representing
  a 45% reduction.
</div>
```

#### Keyboard Navigation

**Ensure images within interactive elements are accessible**:
```html
<button class="case-study-card" aria-label="View Petroverse case study details">
  <img src="case-study.webp" alt="" role="presentation">
  <h3>Oil & Gas: Stop $200K Equipment Failures</h3>
</button>
```

#### Component Updates Required

**Next.js Image Component Integration**:

1. Update `src/components/sections/hero.tsx`:
```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export function Hero() {
  return (
    <section className="relative min-h-screen...">
      <div className="absolute inset-0">
        <Image
          src="/images/hero/home-hero.webp"
          alt="Business professionals analyzing data dashboards"
          fill
          priority
          className="object-cover"
          sizes="100vw"
        />
        <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-primary-900/90..." />
      </div>
      {/* Existing content */}
    </section>
  )
}
```

2. Update case studies page to use actual images instead of placeholders

3. Create image optimization utility function

4. Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images

#### Optimization Scripts

**Create `/scripts/optimize-images.js`**:
```javascript
// Script to batch optimize images using sharp
const sharp = require('sharp');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

async function optimizeImage(inputPath, outputPath) {
  await sharp(inputPath)
    .webp({ quality: 80 })
    .toFile(outputPath);

  console.log(`Optimized: ${inputPath} -> ${outputPath}`);
}

// Batch process all images in /public/images/
```

## Best Practices Summary

### The "Rule of Three" for Image Selection

1. **Relevance**: Does this image directly relate to the content?
2. **Quality**: Is this image professional, high-resolution, well-composed?
3. **Emotional Impact**: Does this image evoke the right feeling (trust, excitement, relief)?

If any answer is "no," find a better image.

---

### The "5-Second Test"

Show the image to someone unfamiliar with your business:
- **2 seconds**: They understand it's about business/technology
- **5 seconds**: They grasp the specific context (AI, automation, specific industry)
- **8 seconds**: They feel something (trust, hope, urgency)

If they're confused or feel nothing, it's the wrong image.

---

### The "Mobile-First Check"

1. View every image on a mobile device (375px width)
2. Can you still tell what the image shows?
3. Is text over the image still readable?
4. Does it load in under 3 seconds?

If no to any, adjust size/compression or choose different image.

---

### Avoid These Common Mistakes

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Use obviously staged stock photos (models staring at camera, fake laughing)
- ❌ Choose images with dated technology (old computers, flip phones)
- ❌ Use images with visible watermarks or low resolution
- ❌ Select images that don't match your target audience demographics
- ❌ Ignore mobile rendering (image too detailed to see on small screens)
- ❌ Use images with distracting backgrounds
- ❌ Choose images that compete with your CTA buttons
- ❌ Use the same image multiple times on same page

**DO**:
- ✅ Choose authentic-looking business scenarios
- ✅ Use modern technology and current professional attire
- ✅ Select high-quality, professional photography
- ✅ Represent diverse teams and industries
- ✅ Test images on multiple devices
- ✅ Use clean, professional backgrounds
- ✅ Ensure images support and guide attention to CTAs
- ✅ Create visual variety across page sections

---
